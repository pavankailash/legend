	In the time I have known you, you have blossomed to become a wonderful person. You are the epitome of life. <br>
	You evolve and adapt to adversaries and environments with ease, a feat not many do effortlessly as you.(the others include me :P)<br> As everyone knows regarding your nature, you have always been a cheerful, bubbly, highly energetic and naughty girl.<br> But not many know the strong character and wonderful being you are being on the inside. <br> Your ability to understand basic human emotion and also comprehend its complexities is one of your profound gifts. <br>Enough of the nice stuff, because I can get carried away writing good things about you. <br> This birthday is certainly special, as every other birthday is, because obviously it is the day this devilish angel(oxymoron :P) came to exist. <br> I think it was like DC Marvel Crossover Event for the Gods and Devils(Lame -_- :P). <br> Crazy, Paithiyakari, Mandu and so many personalities you are. The master mandu.(I love this one). Hahaha. <br> 
 	No matter what happens, you'll always be my bestest friend and closest companion.<br> I will always be by your side and support you in every endeavour you undertake.
